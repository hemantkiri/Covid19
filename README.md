## Machine Learning Model

## Takes in data in from above description of the source of data:
I am using Regression model from Supervised Learning to find "how quickly Covid-19 will hit to all the coundries in the world"?

During the fiest seven months of 2020, vaccination was not found and any guideline to prevent from Covid-19 was not inplace,
so prediction in confirm and deaths cases was unexpected.
