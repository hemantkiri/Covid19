Covid-19, an acute respiratory illness in humans caused by coronavirus, capable of producing severe symptoms and in some cases death, especially in older people and those with underlying health condition. It was originally identified in Wuhan, China in 2019 and because pandemic in 2020. Since the virus has shown evidence of human-to-human transmission, by the end of January 2020, approximately over 8000 cases have been confirmed.

## Reason the topic was selected:
Covid-19 is a situation that has affected many people worldwide and has changed their lifestyles in many ways. Online schools and work. Unlimited hours of doctors and nursesâ€™ duties to save someones' lives.

## Questions the team hopes to answer with the data:
What is the population of each country?
How many people got effected daily?
How many people died in each country daily?
How many people got affected on a weekly basis and how many people died from each country on a weekly basis?
How fast Covid-19 will hit to all 187 countries?
How many people got affected and died from Santa Clara County?

## Machine Learning Model

## Takes in data in from the provisional database:
From supervised Learning, I am using Regression to predict how fast Covid-19 will hit to all 187 countries.  Since no country in world had any vaccination or guidelines to prevent from this virus number of cases has grown very quickly. I am using day_wise.csv file.

## Outputs label(s) for input data:

## Database Integration
## Team members present a provisional database that stands in for the final database and accomplishes the following:

## Sample data that mimics the expected final database structure or schema:
